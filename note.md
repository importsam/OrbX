Need to add density estimation to clusters, do not pre-process.
Need to make clusters stricter, somehow this must be measured.

One of the main problems in the tsne space is that separated clusters are not being considered their own, should change with strictness.
Need to write the section on clustering with what is here, change later per new findings and ideas.
